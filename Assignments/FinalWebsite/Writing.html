  <p id="userOpinion">Artificial intelligence is rapidly evolving and changing industries all over the world,  its already heavily affected entertainment, and has even reached as far as the healthcare  industry. However one field that AI has been seeping itself into that can affect how future  individuals operate, that being school. AI is being used by both instructors and students,  even though AI is tempting because of its ease of use and efficiency, its growing presence  withing education is posing a serious threat to the learning process as a whole. While AI  may be helpful, the use of it within a school setting is undermining critical thinking, a  genuine learning experience, and even the human connection that makes the education  system more meaningful than words on a page. AI should not be incorporated into learning environments, from Grade school all the way to  Grad School, its use discourages deep cognitive development, it enables academic  dishonesty, and it diminishes the vital role of human educators in ensuring intellectual and  emotional growth. Learning has always been a process of struggle, reflection, and discovery, which in turn  leads to positive results. When students rely on the use of AI to generate answers, solve  problems, or write essays, they are bypassing the mental effort that leads to understanding, essentially, students who rely on AI are ripping the oppurtunity to learn  from their own hands. Especially in younger students, whose brains are still developing, AI  isnt a tool that assists learning, it is one that hinders cognitive growth. Memorization,  problem solving, creativity, all are sklills that are honed through active engagement with  content, not passive consumption of AI generated content. If students are conditioned  early on to rely on AI for help, it can very well devolve into reliance for answers, in turn they  will slowly worsen the ability to think, to problem solve. Learning will move further into  abnormality for them.  AI tools like ChatGPT or other chatbots can make it very tempting for students of any level  to cheat, its the easy way out of any assignment. Why wrestle with a difficult essay prompt  when an app can provide the writing for you within seconds? Why practice math problems  when a chatbot can give you the step by step solution? This results in a culture of shortcuttaking, and it erodes academic integrity. However there are definitely students who use AI  “responsibly”, not wanting to cheat but just need assistance, that line that constitutes  assistance and plagarism/cheating is becoming blurrier as AI continues to improve. Which  results in teachers struggling to assess any students real ability, and learning outcomes or  academic goals become meaningless.  Teaching is much more than just delivering information to your students, it’s about  mentorship, encouragement, and human connection, nobody wants to learn with an  instructor who just throws information into their face. AI cannot replace that judgement, or  adaptiveness of a skilled instructor, people like myself dont learn well with nothing but  information on a document. Human connection makes learning not only easier, but also  more enjoyable, if AI becomes a replacement or substitute for real educators, students  may become more isolated and adapt to that learning style of pure information on a  screen, rather than engaging with instructors and peers. Education thrives through  dialogue, feedback, and real human interaction, while you may maintain the information AI  would give you, learning to work with others is a real life skill, and that is something that AI  cannot provide for you.  Allowing AI to become a crutch for students, or a tool for instructors is not only going to  affect a students learning in the moment, but it will most likely have long term  consequences for their futures. Critical thinking, communication, and problem solving, are  some of the most crucial skills for individuals looking for work, they are some of the most  in demand skills. Yet these skills are exactly what is being skipped over by these students if  they rely heavily on AI. If graduates are entering the job market having relied on AI to get  themselves there, they will struggle to adapt to real world situations that require flexible  thinking and independent judgement, this will vary in severity from person to person, but  especially for new graduates, the schooling system and the students themselves should  be prioritizing to set up a student for the “real world” as best as they can. If AI is in the  picture, the students skill set is completely a mystery, to instructors, to employers, and to  the students themselves.  Many argue that AI can support learning and offers personalized instruction, student by  student, which is something that teachers may simply not have time for. Or that it can free  up time for teachers to do more meaningful work. While this does sound helpful, it  assumes that AI is accurate, unbiased, and capable of nuanced understanding. AI tools  often make errors, lack cultural sensitivity, and cannot assess emotional or contextual  needs. Mores, the more that students rely on AI, the less motivated they become to ask for  help or think critically. Rather than support education, AI risks replacing real effort, with  meaningless automation.  From Grade School classrooms to University lecture halls, the rise of AI threatens to  reduce education to a series of interactions between student and machine. This will not  only damage learning, but it will devalue the human elements that make education  adaptable. Students need to be challenged, not taking the easy route with convenient AI  chatbots. AI has its place, in data analysis, in scheduling, in menial tasks. But it has no  right to seep into the classroom, if we care at all about our futures, or future generations, AI  must stay out from education</p>
  <p id="aiOpinion" style="display:none;">Artificial intelligence is evolving at a rapid pace, reshaping industries across the globe. From entertainment to healthcare, its influence is undeniable. But one area where AI is making a quiet yet dangerous entrance is in education—a space that shapes how future generations think, learn, and grow. Both students and teachers are beginning to integrate AI into their routines, and while it offers convenience and speed, its growing presence poses a serious threat to genuine learning.

Despite its potential usefulness, AI in schools is undermining critical thinking, disrupting the authenticity of the learning process, and eroding the human connections that give education true meaning. From grade school to graduate programs, AI should not be a regular feature in classrooms. It discourages deep intellectual development, makes academic dishonesty easier, and diminishes the essential role of human educators in fostering emotional and cognitive growth.

Learning has always been rooted in challenge, self-reflection, and discovery—experiences that help students grow. When students turn to AI to write essays, solve problems, or provide answers, they bypass the effort that leads to understanding. In doing so, they rob themselves of the opportunity to learn. For younger students especially, whose minds are still developing, AI is not a tool for support—it is a hindrance. Skills like memorization, creativity, and problem-solving are sharpened through active engagement, not passive consumption of AI-generated content. Early reliance on AI can create long-term dependency, weakening students' ability to think critically and independently.

Tools like ChatGPT make cheating more tempting than ever. Why struggle through a tough writing assignment when an app can produce an essay instantly? Why practice solving equations when a chatbot delivers the solution in seconds? This convenience creates a culture of shortcuts, where academic integrity becomes harder to uphold. Even students who use AI "responsibly" walk a fine line between assistance and plagiarism. As a result, teachers are finding it increasingly difficult to evaluate a student’s true capabilities, making grades and learning outcomes less meaningful.

Teaching is more than the delivery of information—it’s mentorship, encouragement, and human connection. No one wants to learn from an instructor who simply dumps content. AI lacks the judgment, empathy, and flexibility that skilled educators bring to the classroom. For students like me, learning thrives through conversation, feedback, and genuine interaction—not a screen filled with auto-generated responses. If AI replaces real instructors, students risk becoming more isolated, adapting to a style of education that lacks emotional depth and collaboration.

Allowing students and instructors to lean on AI not only harms learning in the moment—it can have long-lasting effects. Skills like critical thinking, communication, and problem-solving are among the most valuable in the job market. Yet those are the exact skills students miss out on when they let AI do the work. Graduates who relied on AI to get through school may struggle when they enter the workforce and face complex, real-world challenges. The educational system should prepare students for life, and that means fostering real ability—not artificial performance.

Supporters of AI in education argue that it offers personalized instruction and frees teachers to focus on more meaningful tasks. While this sounds beneficial, it assumes that AI is always accurate, unbiased, and emotionally intelligent—which it isn’t. AI can make factual mistakes, miss cultural nuances, and fail to respond to emotional needs. And the more students rely on it, the less motivated they become to think critically or ask for help. Rather than enriching education, AI risks turning it into a shallow, automated process.

From elementary classrooms to university lecture halls, the growing role of AI in education threatens to reduce learning to a series of robotic interactions. It risks weakening the foundation of real education—human connection, effort, and intellectual struggle. AI has a place in areas like data entry or scheduling, but it does not belong in classrooms. If we care about students, about the future, and about the purpose of education itself, we must keep AI out of schools.

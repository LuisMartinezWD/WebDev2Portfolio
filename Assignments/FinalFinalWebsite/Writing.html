  <p id="userOpinion">Artificial intelligence is rapidly evolving and changing industries all over the world. Its influence is already heavily felt in entertainment and has even reached as far as the healthcare industry. However, one field that AI has been seeping into—one that can affect how future individuals operate—is school. AI is being used by both instructors and students. Even though AI is tempting because of its ease of use and efficiency, its growing presence within education poses a serious threat to the learning process as a whole.<br><br>

While AI may be helpful, its use within a school setting undermines critical thinking, genuine learning experiences, and even the human connection that makes education more meaningful than words on a page. AI should not be incorporated into learning environments, from grade school to graduate school. Its presence discourages deep cognitive development, enables academic dishonesty, and diminishes the vital role of human educators in ensuring intellectual and emotional growth.<br><br>

Learning has always been a process of struggle, reflection, and discovery, which leads to positive results. When students rely on AI to generate answers, solve problems, or write essays, they bypass the mental effort that leads to understanding. Essentially, students who rely on AI are stripping themselves of the opportunity to learn. For younger students especially, whose brains are still developing, AI isn’t a tool that assists learning—it hinders cognitive growth. Memorization, problem-solving, and creativity are skills honed through active engagement, not passive consumption of AI-generated content. If students are conditioned early on to rely on AI for help, it can quickly devolve into full reliance for answers. In turn, their ability to think and problem-solve will weaken. Learning itself will shift into abnormality for them.<br><br>

AI tools like ChatGPT or other chatbots make it incredibly tempting for students to cheat—it becomes an easy way out of any assignment. Why struggle with a difficult essay prompt when an app can generate the writing for you in seconds? Why practice math problems when a chatbot provides step-by-step solutions instantly? This results in a culture of shortcut-taking, eroding academic integrity. While some students may claim they use AI “responsibly,” not intending to cheat but only seeking assistance, the line between assistance and plagiarism is becoming blurrier as AI continues to advance. As a result, teachers are struggling to assess students’ true abilities, rendering academic goals and learning outcomes meaningless.<br><br>

Teaching is much more than simply delivering information—it’s about mentorship, encouragement, and human connection. Nobody wants to learn from an instructor who simply throws information at them. AI lacks the judgment, adaptability, and interpersonal skills that a skilled educator brings to the classroom. People like me don’t learn well from nothing but information on a document. Human connection not only makes learning easier but also more enjoyable. If AI were to replace real educators, students would risk becoming isolated and adapting to a passive style of learning, in which they absorb content from a screen rather than engaging with instructors and peers. Education thrives through dialogue, feedback, and genuine human interaction. While AI can provide information, it cannot offer collaboration or interpersonal skills—both of which are essential in real life.<br><br>

Allowing AI to become a crutch for students or a tool for instructors will not only harm a student’s learning in the moment—it will likely have long-term consequences for their future. Critical thinking, communication, and problem-solving are among the most crucial skills in today’s job market. Yet these are the exact skills skipped over when students rely on AI. Graduates entering the workforce having leaned on AI throughout their education may struggle to adapt to real-world situations requiring flexible thinking and independent judgment. The severity of these consequences will vary by individual, but especially for new graduates, the education system and students themselves should prioritize preparing them for the “real world.” If AI is heavily incorporated, a student’s true skill set becomes a mystery—to instructors, to employers, and even to themselves.<br><br>

Many argue that AI can support learning and offer personalized instruction, catering to individual students—something teachers may not always have time for. Others claim that AI can free up teachers to focus on more meaningful tasks. While this sounds helpful in theory, it assumes that AI is entirely accurate, unbiased, and capable of nuanced understanding. In reality, AI often makes mistakes, lacks cultural sensitivity, and cannot assess emotional or contextual needs. Furthermore, the more students rely on AI, the less motivated they become to ask for help or think critically. Rather than supporting education, AI risks replacing real effort with meaningless automation.<br><br>

From grade school classrooms to university lecture halls, the rise of AI threatens to reduce education to a series of robotic interactions between student and machine. This will not only damage learning but will also devalue the human elements that make education adaptable and engaging. Students need to be challenged, not allowed to take the easy route with AI chatbots. AI has its place in data analysis, scheduling, and menial tasks—but it has no place in the classroom. If we care about the future of students, future generations, and the purpose of education itself, AI must be kept out of schools.</p>
  <p id="aiOpinion" style="display:none;">Artificial intelligence is evolving at a rapid pace, reshaping industries across the globe. From entertainment to healthcare, its influence is undeniable. But one area where AI is making a quiet yet dangerous entrance is in education—a space that shapes how future generations think, learn, and grow. Both students and teachers are beginning to integrate AI into their routines, and while it offers convenience and speed, its growing presence poses a serious threat to genuine learning.<br><br>

Despite its potential usefulness, AI in schools is undermining critical thinking, disrupting the authenticity of the learning process, and eroding the human connections that give education true meaning. From grade school to graduate programs, AI should not be a regular feature in classrooms. It discourages deep intellectual development, makes academic dishonesty easier, and diminishes the essential role of human educators in fostering emotional and cognitive growth.<br><br>

Learning has always been rooted in challenge, self-reflection, and discovery—experiences that help students grow. When students turn to AI to write essays, solve problems, or provide answers, they bypass the effort that leads to understanding. In doing so, they rob themselves of the opportunity to learn. For younger students especially, whose minds are still developing, AI is not a tool for support—it is a hindrance. Skills like memorization, creativity, and problem-solving are sharpened through active engagement, not passive consumption of AI-generated content. Early reliance on AI can create long-term dependency, weakening students' ability to think critically and independently.<br><br>

Tools like ChatGPT make cheating more tempting than ever. Why struggle through a tough writing assignment when an app can produce an essay instantly? Why practice solving equations when a chatbot delivers the solution in seconds? This convenience creates a culture of shortcuts, where academic integrity becomes harder to uphold. Even students who use AI "responsibly" walk a fine line between assistance and plagiarism. As a result, teachers are finding it increasingly difficult to evaluate a student’s true capabilities, making grades and learning outcomes less meaningful.<br><br>

Teaching is more than the delivery of information—it’s mentorship, encouragement, and human connection. No one wants to learn from an instructor who simply dumps content. AI lacks the judgment, empathy, and flexibility that skilled educators bring to the classroom. For students like me, learning thrives through conversation, feedback, and genuine interaction—not a screen filled with auto-generated responses. If AI replaces real instructors, students risk becoming more isolated, adapting to a style of education that lacks emotional depth and collaboration.<br><br>

Allowing students and instructors to lean on AI not only harms learning in the moment—it can have long-lasting effects. Skills like critical thinking, communication, and problem-solving are among the most valuable in the job market. Yet those are the exact skills students miss out on when they let AI do the work. Graduates who relied on AI to get through school may struggle when they enter the workforce and face complex, real-world challenges. The educational system should prepare students for life, and that means fostering real ability—not artificial performance.<br><br>

Supporters of AI in education argue that it offers personalized instruction and frees teachers to focus on more meaningful tasks. While this sounds beneficial, it assumes that AI is always accurate, unbiased, and emotionally intelligent—which it isn’t. AI can make factual mistakes, miss cultural nuances, and fail to respond to emotional needs. And the more students rely on it, the less motivated they become to think critically or ask for help. Rather than enriching education, AI risks turning it into a shallow, automated process.<br><br>

From elementary classrooms to university lecture halls, the growing role of AI in education threatens to reduce learning to a series of robotic interactions. It risks weakening the foundation of real education—human connection, effort, and intellectual struggle. AI has a place in areas like data entry or scheduling, but it does not belong in classrooms. If we care about students, about the future, and about the purpose of education itself, we must keep AI out of schools.</p>

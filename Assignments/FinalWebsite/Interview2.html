  <p>1. Are you aware that many students are using AI not only to help them with their  schoolwork, but also to complete their assignments entirely? How do you feel about this?  Do you think its a shortcut to success or is it part of the new age of education and learning? - I am aware, I've seen this happen before, the fact that people are using AI to their  advantage is smart, using tools to support them in their assignments. It's comforting to  know that there is new technology for students to use and somewhat concerning the  amount of lack of effort that is now put in daily into schoolwork and such. I think that in  today’s world, using tools that can help carve your way to success is ideal. With its evergrowing bar being raised every year, students can use what they can access to help them  succeed in their assignments.  2. Have you ever used AI to support you through an assignment? If you have, did you use it  sparingly or did you rely on it to complete the whole assignment? Do you think there is a  way for instructors to prevent AI from being used to complete assignments in their  entirety? - Definitely, whether to generate a simple answer, or to use it to simplify a long reading, in  order to cut the time it would take to complete an assignment. Probably not, since the  growth of tech and AI is everlasting, and instructors can be behind on the methods the  younger generation are using. 3. Did you know that some educators/Instructors are using AI tools to develop lesson plans  and reaching materials for their classes? How do you feel about AI being integrated into  teaching? Do you think it can help the learning experience or will it remove all personality  and interpersonal connections? - Thats being resourceful, instructors always have it rough, so them having a tool to  support them in their work helps, as long as its accurate and fits what theyre teaching. AI  being integrated into teaching can be done well, but can also turn out to be bad, since AI  can be wrong, so teaching something that can possibly be wrong to students, can be  catastrophic. 4.Regardless of your personal use, do you think that AI should have a place in the  classroom? Do you think both instructors and students can use it productively, or will it  just serve as a shortcut for quick results?  - I think it can help play a slight role in the classroom, but it cant be used for everything, as  the instructors and students have to play a role too, in order to learn and succeed in other  lessons and teaching, whilst not relying on AI completely.  5. From your perspective, does using AI to assist with assignments enhance learning for  students, or does it risk making students more reliant and less engaged? Do you think  there is a balance between using AI for help and doing the work on your own that can be  achieved? How do you think this affects long term learning and retention of students? -There definitely is a balance, I have that balance, letting AI explain a topic, and learning  what that topic is, and then writing what I can remember. This can cause long term learning  to be cut short, as the 16 years of school can finally be shortened as more and more  people use the internet and the resources they can find to succeed in life, even without a  college degree, but is overall cutting the retention of students due to them thinking that its  not worth it anymore to spend thousands of dollars on a degree. 6. Have you heard from any professors regarding student’s use of AI tools? What have they  said about AI use? Have you noticed changes in the way that assignments are structured or  graded because of it? - I've just heard what they always say, no using AI to complete assignments, and others  tolerate it to help, if you also put in the effort to complete the assignment yourself. I haven't  seen a noticeable change in assignments, but i am starting to see more assignments being  more interactive and creative. 7. Do you think it’s fair that some students rely on AI to complete assignments while others  are putting in the effort themselves? How do you think AI use and presence affects  academic integrity? - Its, difficult to answer that question, as some people do exploit AI to the extreme, having  them be carried hundreds of times on their assigments, but overall, using what is available  to you, and using the tools for success, is sometimes necessary to succeed now in the 21st century. There definitely has to be more regulation on AI, but overall, its a tool that can help  struggling students succeed. 8.If Columbia were to implement a complete ban on AI tools, would you support that  decision or oppose it? Why? What impact would the ban have on your academic  experience? - I would have mixed feelings, on one hand, i can see why they would have it banned,on the  other, its a tool that helps said struggling students in dire times, even if its to have it explain  a simple passage in simple terms, but exploiting it to the max would be bad. It wouldnt  have much impact, as ive always done my assigments myself, but overall it would cause  me to retain the old ways of studying and reading boring long old passages on  shakespeare.  9. Do you think AI could be beneficial for students with specific learning challenges, such  as those with learning disabilities or language barriers? Should AI be a tool that they should  rely on or do you think the school should do more to accommodate them?  - YES, definitely, as their struggle would be cut short with the help of AI. I think they should  accomodate more help for students with learning challenges, but also implement  resources that could help them succeed, maybe even using AI. 10.If your professor decided to use AI for grading your assignments, how would you feel  about that? Would it make the grading process seem more objective and honest, or would  it feel too impersonal and cant accomadate for specific scenarios? It would, be an improvement. Some professors dont grade until the last second, so you  have no idea that one assignment can indefinitely screw your grade over, this can help  lighten the load on the hundreds of students they teach, as long as it can accomodate with  certain lesson plans. 11. Looking ahead, do you think future students will need to learn how to use AI  responsibly, similar to skills in writing or coding? If so, how should AI literacy be taught?  Can AI be “Mastered”, or do you think its a tool reserved for small, menial tasks such as  searching the web for answers? - AI can definitely be mastered, but it can also be used for purposes other than just  completing assignments, coding majors can be helped with this process, and writers can  use the tool to try and help the author to speed up the long writing process. AI can be  devastating however, and as long as us students put in the effort too, AI can be a useful  tool to help out our 16 year learning experience.</p>

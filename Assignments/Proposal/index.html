<h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>

<main> 
<p>		For my final website I would like to focus on Artificial intelligence to some capacity, 
I am torn between on expanding upon the idea I proposed in Assignment 1 which was that AI is incapable of killing design, 
whether that is web design or art, many people look down on AI for these purposes but I think that AI is incapable of destroying the workspace for the individuals
 who are present in those communities as there are many individuals who would much rather have real,
 unique individuals create for them and will continue to admire their work. But another idea that I
 thought was really interesting that was also pertaining towards AI is the growing use of AI in schools,
 for both instructors and students alike, while I believe that AI cannot kill the creative central of a person
 and wont kill design, I do think that AI can greatly negatively affect individuals and their skillsets if not
 handled properly, ESPECIALLY in a school setting.
 There is a large rise of instructors using AI to create lesson plans for their students, 
 not only is this lazy, but it takes away from individuality and doesnt allow for the instructor
 to accommodate for any students who may be lacking or learn in different ways. Both of these ideas are 
 very important for me, as someone who is surrounded by creatives in my friend group and my family,
 the idea that AI is absolutely going to dethrone and overwhelm human made art and design is growing,
 even though there still is and will continue to be a huge market for art and design made by HUMANS.
 AI can't take away the love that people have for human made creative work. As for the growth of AI in
 schools for both instructors and students, still ties into my friends and family, I have so many friends
 that are studying to become educators, if AI becomes the norm and is fully infiltrating the teaching process
 then it is going to really effect my friends who are studying to be educators, the norm will change and
 being a good educator will change from being able to cater to each students needs and adapt to your class,
 and devolve into who can use AI the best to make a good lesson plan. When it comes to students who are going
 through school with AI, I have a younger sister who is a freshman in high school and cousins who are still
 in middle school,  if the norm of instruction is becoming Ai generated work plans,
 I worry for their individuality in a classroom, worry that their instructors wont see them and their struggles
 if they have any, I also worry that they themselves will begin using AI to help with their work which will
 result in a weaker work ethic and inevitably cause them to struggle with their actual intelligence and learning
 capabilities. Both of these topics are super important to me because they can heavily influence the people that
 are close to me and their futures.  
</p>

<p>
	Some research artifacts that I may find useful is statistics on how often AI is being used in schools,
	students and instructors, or statistics on how often AI is used in creative fields.
	Besides on how often AI is used in the fields I think it is useful to find statistics on how AI is truly 
	affecting both industries, whether it is lower test scores or lower attention spans, or less money earned
	from creative work, having set data is super important.  

 
</p>


<p>
	I need to learn more on how exactly AI is being used in each field respectively,
	I do know that teachers are using it to create lesson plans at the very least,
	but I want to see if there are other parts of instruction where AI is injecting itself into.
	I do think that understanding how AI works in these situations is also useful, 
	if I can find out how AI is putting together lesson plans or taking into consideration the prompt given
	for creative work, understanding how accurate AI can be is very important. To get the idea across that
	AI cant kill creativity or how it is going to negatively affect schooling and education,
	understanding how AI lacks in ways that humans don't is incredibly important and can make the research
	and project as a whole much simpler.

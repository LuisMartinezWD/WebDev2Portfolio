<h1>AI Cant Kill Design</h1>

<p>		“God is dead. He remains dead. And we have killed him.” A statement like this would make one believe that the world is ending,
 yet the only thing that is truly occurring is that there is a new aspect to take into consideration in the design industry.
 AI as a whole gets a bad reputation because people believe that it is capable of doing absolutely everything that a person can and beyond,
 however generative AI is not capable of thinking, not in the traditional sense at least.
</p>

<p>
	Graphic design can be solved with an equation, there are near infinite possibilities and ways to format a design.
Moving back to the idea that AI can't think in the traditional sense, AI is based on what we as humans already know, we can't feed AI knowledge
 that we don't already have in our grasp, for AI to outperform you means that you are not performing to the highest degree possible.
 Obviously being perfect 24/7 is absolutely impossible by all senses of the idea, however design isn't confined to a single yes or no answer.
 The beauty behind design is being able to cater to clients needs, crafting their idea of perfection, all while blending in your creativity.
 Design is an art form, while AI can be used to create what the client wants or help an artist to design what the client needs,
 it can never recreate the charm and character that a fully human led design project provides.
</p>


<p>
	One aspect of the article I disagree with entirely is the idea that “organic designers” who refuse to use AI may make an uprising,
 however like I said before, design is an art form, it is many people's lives.
 The article mentions that these organic designers may cost more but it will have its following of people who prefer it,
 in a way this implies that if it weren't for AI being a factor, all design despite skill or passion is all the same, value wise at least.
 With design being a skill that many work towards and perfect, a higher price shouldnt be a surprise, even before AI was a factor,
 people care about their work, how it's presented and how it's used. The appearance of AI isn't going to drive prices up,
 it isn't going to revolutionize the design world and it certainly isn't going to ruin it either.
 Design has been ever changing, whether it is posters to advertise political campaigns before the internet ever existed,
 or its a 15 second advertisement to promote a brand new video game, there have been a large variety of tools that weren't there the year prior.

</p>


<p>
	Design is always evolving, peoples taste, skill sets, tools that are being used, and the audience that it is meant to portray to.
 AI doesn't break any “rules”, many people don't like how simplistic it can be, how easy it can make a design,
 or possibly even knock away potential work for truly skilled designers. But this simply will not happen, times change,
 people's interests change, if a client wants something that was never made before, how can an AI accomplish making it?
 Human cooperation is what has always been pushing the design industry forward and it will continue to stay that way.
 Customers who care about having the absolute cream of the crop will stay away from pure AI designs,
 designers who truly care for their work and are passionate about what they put out into the world will not use pure AI designs.
 That doesn't mean that AI won't make an appearance, <strong>it just won't overthrow the design market.</strong>
 Remembering that the world of design is ever changing is important, but learning to adapt is even more important.
